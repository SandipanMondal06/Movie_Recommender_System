# Content-Based Recommender System

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Content-Based Recommender System** using the **Bag of Words (BoW)** model. The system is designed to recommend items (e.g., movies, books, or products) based on their content features, such as descriptions, tags, or other textual data.

## Features of the Project
1. **Content-Based Filtering:**
   - Recommendations are based solely on the features of the items and their similarity to a target item.

2. **Bag of Words Model:**
   - Textual content is converted into numerical representations using the Bag of Words technique.
   - A term-document matrix is constructed to analyze and compare item features.

3. **Cosine Similarity:**
   - To find the most similar items, the cosine similarity metric is used to compute the similarity between items in the feature space.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Input data includes a dataset of items with textual descriptions or feature columns.
   - Example columns: `Title`, `Description`, `Tags`, etc.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess the text data (e.g., remove punctuation, stop words, and apply stemming/lemmatization).
   - Tokenize the text and vectorize it using the Bag of Words model.

3. **Similarity Calculation:**
   - Generate a term-document matrix from the Bag of Words representation.
   - Compute the cosine similarity between items.

4. **Recommendation:**
   - For a given target item, retrieve the top-N most similar items based on their cosine similarity scores.

## Implementation Details
- **Libraries Used:**
  - Python
  - `scikit-learn` for Bag of Words and similarity computation.
  - `pandas` for data handling.
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.

- **Key Code Components:**
  - **Preprocessing:** Tokenizing and vectorizing text data.
  - **Bag of Words:** Using `CountVectorizer` from `scikit-learn`.
  - **Similarity Computation:** Using `cosine_similarity` from `sklearn.metrics.pairwise`.

## Example Output
- Given a target item (e.g., a movie title), the system provides a ranked list of similar items based on content features.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the recommender system script:
   ```bash
   python recommender.py
   ```

4. Provide input for the target item (or use default examples) and view recommendations.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate **TF-IDF** for better feature representation.
- Extend to hybrid recommendation by combining content-based and collaborative filtering methods.
- Add user-interface support for seamless interaction.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how a Content-Based Recommender System can be effectively built using the Bag of Words model. It provides a strong foundation for understanding content-based recommendation techniques and can be extended for real-world applications.
